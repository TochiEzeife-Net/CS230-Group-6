Objective:
Ride4U is an electric bike renting service allowing people commuting through the city with a reliable form of transportation at a fair price. 
Using our mobile app you will be able to choose a charge station to pick up a bike. Then using the code provided when completing your transaction you can unlock and ride.
In the next 5 years Ride4U will expand our reach to the national scale. We wish to provide a convenient, accessible, and speedy form of transportation for our consumers. 
Our state of the art, electric bikes will provide the community with more options for their commute. Our goal is to have an e-bike charging station in every major city in the United States. 
To accomplish this massive goal we have some key results we want to reach. 

Key Result 1: Ride4U e-bikes will be available for use in every major city
Focus has been put into planting the charging stations in the busiest areas of the city to maximize use. We have spared no expense to ensure that our bikes are top of the line. 
As such heavy fines will be incurred for any damage to either the e-bike or its charging terminal. We want to ensure the necessary amount of bikes are available for use to support a whole city. 

Key Result 2: Increase mobile app users.
We hope that by expanding our platform throughout the nation we will see growth in the amount of downloads of our mobile app.

Key Result 3: Providing a quality product that can contend with our competitors
We are aware of our competition  Zoomo, Bay wheels, Bolt, etc and have studied their business models extensively. We can safely say we can provide a service on par with the top e-bike services. 
We pride ourselves on being a quick, reliable, commuting service that continues to improve day by day. To this end we are partnering with different parts retailers, electronics experts, and mobile app developers to guarantee quality on all fronts. 
Our mobile app allows a seamless renting process no matter the location. Simply pick the closest charging location and unlock your bike using the app. 
Ride4U is dedicated to revolutionizing urban transportation with an efficient, sustainable, and accessible e-bike rental service. 
By expanding to every major U.S. city and maintaining a high standard of quality, we aim to become a dominant player in the micro-mobility industry. 
Our strategic partnerships, commitment to innovation, and focus on customer satisfaction will drive our long-term success.

Key Metric: Total cost of expansion
We are discussing the costs of building charging stations in every city and the total cost is about 11.7 million. 
This includes the cost of production for the e-bikes as well as the construction costs for the charging centers.
Each charging station will hold 8 e-bikes the cost of production being around $3000 each. Each charging station costs approximately $8000 to build. 
Spread across 366 cities around the U.S. adds up to the 11.7 million dollar sum. Of course we want to ensure that our charging stations follow all the proper city regulations

Ethical Impact/issues:
In addition to providing transportation for commuters in the city we also want to emphasize our goal of reducing carbon emission in the U.S. 
As we are providing an electric vehicle service we hope that we can be used as a substitute for cars, buses, and motorcycles that have a high carbon footprint. 
We also want to be transparent on the ecological concerns of our e-bikes. The recycling of e-bike batteries can be very difficult and if not done properly can turn into environmental pollution.

Ethical Safeguard:
To combat this risk we take absolute responsibility for our batteries, making sure that they are properly recycled to prevent damage to the environment.

OKR 2. 
Objective: Speak with city officials to ensure safety on the road (Samuel)
E-bikes have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation, offering an efficient, eco-friendly and cost-effective way to travel. 
However, with their growing presence on the roads, it is crucial to ensure they adhere to all traffic regulations and maintain the safety of both riders and pedestrians. 
Engaging with city officials to address r-bike safety can lead to improved infrastructure, better enforcement of regulations, and increased public awareness.  

Key Result: Ensure that E-Bikes Follow All Road Regulations and Guarantee Passenger Safety.
One of the most pressing concerns regarding e-bikes is the compliance with existing traffic laws. Many cities have different classifications for e-bikes based on their speed, motor power, and whether they require pedaling.  
Ensuring that e-bike riders are aware of and follow these regulations is essential to maintaining order on the road. To achieve this, city officials should work on clearly defining e-bike classifications and ensuring riders know the rules. 
Regulations should specify where e-bikes are allowed to operate (e.g., bike lanes, roads, or multi-use paths), speed limits, helmet requirements, and whether licensing or registration is necessary. 
Collaboration with local transportation authorities and law enforcement can help streamline these regulations and enforce compliance. 
Additionally, safety measures such as mandatory helmet laws, restrictions on carrying passengers on certain e-bike types, and proper lighting and reflectors should be emphasized. 
Riders should also be required to undergo safety training, similar to traditional bicycle safety courses, to ensure they understand road rules and best practices for defensive riding.

Key Result: Advocate for Proper Infrastructure, Such as Bike Lanes and signage, to Accommodate E-Bikes safely.
One of the most effective ways to ensure e-bike safety is by investing in proper infrastructure. Many cities are not yet fully equipped to accommodate e-bikes, leading to conflicts between cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. 
Dedicated bike lanes, clear signage, and designated parking areas for e-bikes can significantly reduce accidents and improve traffic flow. 
City officials should be encouraged to expand bike lane networks, ensuring they are wide enough to accommodate both traditional cyclists and e-bike riders safely. 
Protected bike lanes, separated from vehicular traffic by physical barriers, can greatly reduce the risk of collisions. Moreover, clear signage indicating speed limits, right-of-way rules, and e-bike parking areas will help guide both riders and other road users. 
Municipalities should also consider implementing charging stations and designated parking areas to prevent e-bikes from being left in unsafe or obstructive locations.

Key Result: collaborate with Law Enforcement to Enforce E-bike Regulations and Educate Riders on Road Safety.
Even with well-defined regulations and infrastructure in place, enforcement is necessary to ensure compliance. City officials should work closely with law enforcement agencies to develop clear policies for monitoring e-bike usage. 
Officers should be trained to recognize different e-bike classes and enforce speed limits, helmet requirements, and other safety regulations.
Fines or penalties for reckless riding, such as running red lights or riding on sidewalks where prohibited, should be consistently applied. 
However, enforcement should also be balanced with education. Law enforcement agencies can work alongside transportation departments to conduct safety campaigns, distribute informational materials, and engage with the community through workshops.
Implementing an e-bike safety certification program could also be beneficial. Riders who complete a short safety course could receive certification, incentivizing responsible riding and increasing overall awareness.

Key Result: Promote Community Awareness Programs to Ensure Both E-bike Riders and other Road users Understand safe practices.
Public education is a vital component of ensuring e-bike safety. Both riders and other road users, such as motorists and pedestrians, should be aware of the unique characteristics of e-bikes and how to share the road safely. Cities can organize public awareness campaigns that emphasize the importance of wearing helmets, obeying traffic signals, and maintaining safe speeds. Schools, community centers, and workplaces can serve as venues for educational programs targeting young riders and commuters. Furthermore, partnerships with e-bike manufacturers, retailers, and ride-sharing services can help reinforce safe riding habits. When purchasing or renting an e-bike, riders should receive informational materials and safety tips. Public service announcements, social media campaigns, and outreach events can also play a crucial role in spreading awareness.
