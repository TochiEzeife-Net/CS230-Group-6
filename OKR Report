# 1: Ethical Business Plan

## 1.A. Company Name: Ride4U

Ride4U is an e-bike company that aims to make eco-friendly transportation accessible and affordable. 
The company provides e-bikes as well as a website and mobile app to help users find places to rent and charge them. 
Most data will be stored on our servers. This data includes information about our e-bike charging stations:
where they are located and information about the e-bikes in said stations (their charging status, reservation status, etc.). 
We may also collect and store analytics data on our servers to facilitate revising our website and app for the best 
user experience.

## 1.C.1.1 OKR 1 Objective and Key Result

Ride4U is an electric bike renting service allowing people commuting through the city with a reliable form of 
transportation at a fair price. Using our mobile app you will be able to choose a charge station to pick up a bike.

transportation for our consumers. Our state of the art, electric bikes will provide the community with more options 
for their commute. Our goal is to have an e-bike charging station in every major city in the United States. 
To accomplish this massive goal we have some key results we want to reach. 

## 1.C.1.2 OKR 1 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

Key Result 1: Ride4U e-bikes will be available for use in every major city

Focus has been put into planting the charging stations in the busiest areas of the city to maximize use. 
We have spared no expense to ensure that our bikes are top of the line. As such heavy fines will be incurred 
for any damage to either the e-bike or its charging terminal. We want to ensure the necessary amount of bikes 
are available for use to support a whole city. 

Key Result 2: Increase mobile app users.
We hope that by expanding our platform throughout the nation we will see growth in the amount of downloads of our mobile app.

Key Result 3: Providing a quality product that can contend with our competitors

We are aware of our competition  Zoomo, Bay wheels, Bolt, etc and have studied their business models extensively. 
We can safely say we can provide a service on par with the top e-bike services. We pride ourselves on being a quick,
reliable, commuting service that continues to improve day by day. To this end we are partnering with different parts 
retailers, electronics experts, and mobile app developers to guarantee quality on all fronts. Our mobile app 
allows a seamless renting process no matter the location. Simply pick the closest charging location and 
unlock your bike using the app. Ride4U is dedicated to revolutionizing urban transportation with an efficient, sustainable, 
and accessible e-bike rental service. By expanding to every major U.S. city and maintaining a high standard of quality, 
we aim to become a dominant player in the micro-mobility industry. Our strategic partnerships, commitment to innovation, 
and focus on customer satisfaction will drive our long-term success.

Key Metric: Total cost of expansion
We are discussing the costs of building charging stations in every city and the total cost is about 11.7 million. 
This includes the cost of production for the e-bikes as well as the construction costs for the charging centers.
Each charging station will hold 8 e-bikes the cost of production being around $3000 each. Each charging station costs 
approximately $8000 to build. Spread across 366 cities around the U.S. adds up to the 11.7 million dollar sum. 
Of course we want to ensure that our charging stations follow all the proper city regulations

## 1.C.1.3 OKR 1 Ethical Impact(s)/Issues(s)
In addition to providing transportation for commuters in the city we also want to emphasize our goal of 
reducing carbon emission in the U.S. As we are providing an electric vehicle service we hope that we can
be used as a substitute for cars, buses, and motorcycles that have a high carbon footprint. We also want to be
transparent on the ecological concerns of our e-bikes. The recycling of e-bike batteries can be very difficult 
and if not done properly can turn into environmental pollution. The best way to dispose of these batteries is to return
them to the proveyer. 

## 1.C.1.4 OKR 1 Ethical Safeguards

To combat this risk we take absolute responsibility for our batteries, making sure that they are properly recycled 
to prevent damage to the environment. We will also provide drop off locations for the recycling of electronic 
components along with our charging stations


## 1.C.2.1 OKR 2 Objective and Key Result

Speak with city officials to ensure safety on the road (Samuel)
E-bikes have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation, offering an efficient, eco-friendly and cost-effective 
way to travel. However, with their growing presence on the roads, it is crucial to ensure they adhere to all traffic 
regulations and maintain the safety of both riders and pedestrians. Engaging with city officials to address r-bike 
safety can lead to improved infrastructure, better enforcement of regulations, and increased public awareness.  

## 1.C.2.2 OKR 2 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

Key Result: Ensure that E-Bikes Follow All Road Regulations and Guarantee Passenger Safety.
One of the most pressing concerns regarding e-bikes is the compliance with existing traffic laws. 
Many cities have different classifications for e-bikes based on their speed, motor power, and whether they require pedaling.  
Ensuring that e-bike riders are aware of and follow these regulations is essential to maintaining order on the road. 
To achieve this, city officials should work on clearly defining e-bike classifications and ensuring riders know the rules. 
Regulations should specify where e-bikes are allowed to operate (e.g., bike lanes, roads, or multi-use paths), 
speed limits, helmet requirements, and whether licensing or registration is necessary. Collaboration with local 
transportation authorities and law enforcement can help streamline these regulations and enforce compliance. 
Additionally, safety measures such as mandatory helmet laws, restrictions on carrying passengers on certain e-bike types, 
and proper lighting and reflectors should be emphasized. Riders should also be required to undergo safety training, 
similar to traditional bicycle safety courses, to ensure they understand road rules and best practices for defensive riding.

Key Result: Advocate for Proper Infrastructure, Such as Bike Lanes and signage, to Accommodate E-Bikes safely.
One of the most effective ways to ensure e-bike safety is by investing in proper infrastructure. Many cities are not 
yet fully equipped to accommodate e-bikes, leading to conflicts between cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. 
Dedicated bike lanes, clear signage, and designated parking areas for e-bikes can significantly reduce accidents 
and improve traffic flow. City officials should be encouraged to expand bike lane networks, ensuring they are wide 
enough to accommodate both traditional cyclists and e-bike riders safely. Protected bike lanes, separated from 
vehicular traffic by physical barriers, can greatly reduce the risk of collisions. Moreover, clear signage indicating 
speed limits, right-of-way rules, and e-bike parking areas will help guide both riders and other road users. 
Municipalities should also consider implementing charging stations and designated parking areas to prevent e-bikes 
from being left in unsafe or obstructive locations.

Key Result: collaborate with Law Enforcement to Enforce E-bike Regulations and Educate Riders on Road Safety.
Even with well-defined regulations and infrastructure in place, enforcement is necessary to ensure compliance. 
City officials should work closely with law enforcement agencies to develop clear policies for monitoring e-bike usage. 
Officers should be trained to recognize different e-bike classes and enforce speed limits, helmet requirements, 
and other safety regulations. Fines or penalties for reckless riding, such as running red lights or riding on sidewalks 
where prohibited, should be consistently applied. However, enforcement should also be balanced with education. 
Law enforcement agencies can work alongside transportation departments to conduct safety campaigns, distribute 
informational materials, and engage with the community through workshops. Implementing an e-bike safety certification 
program could also be beneficial. Riders who complete a short safety course could receive certification, 
incentivizing responsible riding and increasing overall awareness.

Key Result: Promote Community Awareness Programs to Ensure Both E-bike Riders and other Road users Understand safe practices.
Public education is a vital component of ensuring e-bike safety. Both riders and other road users, such as motorists and pedestrians, should be aware of the unique characteristics of e-bikes and how to share the road safely. Cities can organize public awareness campaigns that emphasize the importance of wearing helmets, obeying traffic signals, and maintaining safe speeds. Schools, community centers, and workplaces can serve as venues for educational programs targeting young riders and commuters. Furthermore, partnerships with e-bike manufacturers, retailers, and ride-sharing services can help reinforce safe riding habits. When purchasing or renting an e-bike, riders should receive informational materials and safety tips. Public service announcements, social media campaigns, and outreach events can also play a crucial role in spreading awareness.


## 1.C.3.1 OKR 3 Objective and Key Result

Ride4U will use analytics data responsibly to provide a website and mobile app with a seamless and intuitive user experience by the end of our first year.
Key stakeholders include users of the site and the company providing the site.
Ride4U embraces diversity and values bringing communities together.
So, ideally, its services should be designed to accommodate users of any demographic.
For this objective, Ride4U must focus especially on tech novices who may not be familiar with website navigation but may still need to look for eco-friendly means of transportation.
Ride4U must also ensure its services accommodate low-income groups and provide them with affordable options.
For this objective, the users’ and company’s relationship is transactional.
The user provides information about their activity on Ride4U’s sites and services.
Then the company uses that information to revise the site and improve the user experience.

## 1.C.3.2 OKR 3 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

To measure this objective’s success, we could conduct usability tests—evaluating whether users can complete important tasks successfully and independently.
Specifically, we can ask a sample size of 300 new users about which of our service’s features they actually use.
These features might include:  
- Locating nearby e-bike charging stations where users can rent and charge e-bikes  
- Booking an e-bike to rent in advance  
- Check the status of e-bikes in real time  
- Finding e-bike friendly routes  
- Contacting customer service  
If at least 70% of our users can find and complete their desired tasks in under 30 seconds without needing to use our site’s search feature, then we have successfully provided an intuitive user experience.
We focus on new users in this test because their input is more useful. If a new user can navigate our site with little hassle, then an experienced user can definitely do so, too.  

Additionally, after the usability test, participants could take a survey about their experience with using the site.
We will ask them:  
* On a scale of 1–10, how satisfied are you with your experience using this site?  
* Were any of the services provided particularly difficult to use or understand?  
* Would you recommend this site to others?  
  If at least 80% of users are satisfied with their experience, then we can be sure that we have provided our users with not only an intuitive experience but an enjoyable one as well.
Feedback we receive from this survey will also be helpful in figuring out which features we need to prioritize improving.  

In order to provide a seamless experience, our site must also be reliable.
An experiment we could perform to measure this metric involves using tools to monitor our servers’ uptime.
If, over the course of our first year, our servers can maintain an uptime of at least 99%, then we have succeeded at providing a reliable experience for our users.
Regardless of whether we achieve this quota, we should also make information about our servers’ uptime available to our users.
This way, we can hold ourselves accountable in being honest with our servers’ reliability.

## 1.C.3.3 OKR 3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issues(s)

With this objective, one of the greatest ethical issues is the possibility of privacy invasion. Many modern web browsers and sites sell user data to advertisers, so some users may worry that we will do the same. The court case Calhoun v. Google, LLC showcases an example of this ethical issue. In the case, plaintiffs alleged that “Google intentionally and unlawfully causes Chrome to record and send users’ personal information to Google regardless of whether a user elects to Sync or even has a Google account” \[1, p. 7\]. While the court case has not fully been resolved, it highlights the complexities of user privacy and tech companies’ data handling practices.

This table provides a summary of other expected ethical risks:

Table I  
Expected Ethical Impact Risk Table

| Stakeholders | Financial Risk | Privacy Risk | Conflicting Interests Risk | Violation of Rights Risk |
| :----------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| User         | none           | high         | mid                        | high                     |
| Company      | mid            | low          | mid                        | low                      |

Analysis of Ethical Impact Risk:  
User: For users, there is no direct correlation between using Ride4U’s site and financial risks. Regarding privacy, not all users are comfortable with their data being collected without full knowledge of how that data is going to be used and for how long. Users have the right to decide how their data is handled. And if data is not handled properly, then service optimization can incur a high risk of violating these rights. Meanwhile, this objective has a medium conflicting interest risk. Not everyone will use the site the same way. Some users may need to locate places to rent or charge e-bikes; others may use the site to find e-bike-friendly routes; etc.  
Company: Ride4U may want to experiment with different layouts of its site to see what works best for its users. The costs, both in time and money, of doing so can add up over time. Additionally, if the company mishandles user data, they could incur major fines and face legal challenges. The only data that the company handles that belongs to them is their servers’ uptime. While a breach is possible, this information in particular is already made public, so the company runs little risk with their own privacy. Likewise, the company does not run much of a risk of violating their own rights either. Regarding conflicting interests, the company’s intentions with the site may not always match how users actually end up using the site, so the company will have to keep this in mind.

## 1.C.3.4 OKR 3 Ethical Safeguards

From the court case Ferguson et al. v. Apple, we learn that honesty and transparency are essential to providing a good user experience while maintaining trust. In this case, Apple never disclosed that their iOS updates 10.1.1, 10.2.1, and 11.2.0 “negatively impact the performance or utility of \[the iPhone SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, and 7 Plus\]” \[2, p. 5\].

As a consequence of withholding this information, plaintiffs alleged that Apple violated California’s Unfair Competition Law “by making material misrepresentations and failing to disclose material information regarding certain iOS updates” and because their conduct “was immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, unconscionable, and/or substantially injurious” \[2, pp. 17–18\].  
Of the factors we have considered, users’ privacy is at the highest risk when it comes to handling analytics data. As a safeguard, website and UI designers can implement a notification that shows up as soon as a user registers for an account. 
The notification alerts them that we would like to collect data about how they use the site. 
Then, they can decide to opt in or opt out of data collection. 
They may choose to change this decision in the future if they wish. We will let the user know that this data will be deleted after 30 days, and we will clarify why we are using the data: to deduce what we need to focus on when optimizing our site and our users’ experience. 
While this objective should not require any users’ personal data, requesting consent is important because “Users are becoming increasingly aware of their data rights. Implementing robust consent management practices demonstrates a commitment to user privacy, thereby building trust and enhancing reputation” \[3\]. 
By implementing this safeguard, we can show users that we respect their privacy and that they can trust us with their data.  
To measure the effectiveness of this safeguard, we can measure the number of users who choose to opt in to data collection. If over 70% of users opt in, then our safeguard is effective at assuring our users that we will handle their data responsibly. Otherwise, we will have to revise this safeguard or how we handle users’ data.
