# 2. Cultural Policy

## 2.A. Core Values 

At Ride4U we want to be thought of as a commuting tool in the same vein as Uber or Lyft. We are an electric bike 
renting service providing another form of transportation through the city. We are not technically a rideshare service 
as the bikes don’t fit more than one person. What we do provide are quality e-bikes to make your commute easier. 
We want to be known as an affordable, convenient, and eco-friendly form of transportation. 
Our core values as a company are customer service, ecological impact, and innovation. We want to live up to those 
values so we strive to improve our services and closely listen to user feedback. We understand the many problems 
in daily life and don’t want transportation to be one of them. 

Customer Service

We are committed to listening to the opinions of our dedicated users as Ride4U could not run without their support. 
We encourage users to voice their feedback, concerns, and recommendations as it provides us with the framework to 
improve our service. Your voices are valued and Ride4U welcomes them.

Ecological Impact

One of the core values that we held in our minds when creating Ride4U was how we can contribute to environmental change. 
Our goal is to drastically reduce carbon emissions worldwide. That is why we produce only the highest quality 
electric bikes. The e-bikes will allow people to still reach their destination in a timely manner with a far more 
eco-friendly approach.

Innovation

We are always looking to push the envelope when it comes to our products. The safety and comfort of our users is our 
top priority and we will continue to improve our e-bikes as technology improves.

## 2.B. Motivation

The culture we are working to achieve is one that welcomes open communication and encourages creativity. 
We listen openly to the ideas of our team members . We understand the challenges in life and accommodate 
appropriately for our family at Ride4U. We love hearing feedback on our services as we can use that to improve. 
Our only fear as a company is missing out on an opportunity to grow.
